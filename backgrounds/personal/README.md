# Personal Backgrounds

This folder is for your personal background images that won't be committed to git.

## Setup

1. Copy `backgrounds.json.example` to `backgrounds.json`
2. Add your image files to this folder
3. Edit `backgrounds.json` to list your image filenames

## Example

If you add `vacation.jpg` and `sunset.png` to this folder, your `backgrounds.json` should look like:

```json
[
  "vacation.jpg",
  "sunset.png"
]
```

Your personal images will appear after the main backgrounds when cycling through.
