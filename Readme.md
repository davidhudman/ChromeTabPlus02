# Chrome Tab Plus #

This chrome extension lets you see current weather with sunrise and sunset times, cryptocurrency quotes, foreign exchange quotes, and lets you set custom background images to appear when you open a new tab (because I was mad about the people at the Chrome Extension called "Momentum" for trying to charge people monthly to see backgrounds of their choice):
