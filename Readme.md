# Chrome Tab Plus

This chrome extension lets you see:

- Current weather with sunrise and sunset times
- Cryptocurrency quotes
- Foreign exchange quotes
- Lets you set custom background images to appear when you open a new tab

I added the background images option because I was mad about the people at the Chrome Extension called "Momentum" for trying to charge people monthly to see backgrounds of their choice
