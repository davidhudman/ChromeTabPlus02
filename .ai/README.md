# AI Development Guidelines

This directory contains guidelines and best practices designed to make our codebase more AI-friendly. Following these conventions will help AI assistants like Claude, GitHub Copilot, and others provide more accurate and helpful assistance.

## Guidelines

- [Code Style and Formatting](./code-style.md)
- [JavaScript Best Practices](./javascript-practices.md)
- [Linting and Formatting Rules](./linting-rules.md)
- [File Size and Organization](./file-organization.md)
- [Testing Practices](./testing-practices.md)
- [Documentation Standards](./documentation.md)
- [Commit Practices](./commit-practices.md)
- [Environment Variables](./environment-variables.md)

## Why AI-Friendly Code Matters

AI coding assistants work best when code follows consistent patterns and is well-organized. The guidelines in this directory are designed to:

1. **Improve context management**: Keep files small enough that AI models can understand them fully
2. **Enhance predictability**: Consistent formatting helps models generate compatible code
3. **Reduce complexity**: Simpler patterns are easier for AI to understand and extend
4. **Maintain modularity**: Well-separated concerns make it easier for AI to work on specific parts

## Using These Guidelines

These guidelines should be treated as living documents that evolve with our project and AI capabilities. Team members are encouraged to update them as we learn more about effective AI collaboration patterns.
